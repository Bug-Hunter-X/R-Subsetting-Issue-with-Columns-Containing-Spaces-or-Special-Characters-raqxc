This repository demonstrates a common error in R when subsetting data frames using column names that contain spaces or special characters. The `bug.R` file shows the error occurring, while `bugSolution.R` provides the corrected code.  This issue arises from the way R handles column names with non-standard characters.  The solution leverages techniques that handle such names correctly.
